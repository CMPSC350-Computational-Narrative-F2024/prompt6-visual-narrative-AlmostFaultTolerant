Generate a tiny giraffe walking across a desert in a regular show art style
Try more of a minimalist less vibrant color style
Using the same style, have the tiny giraffe find a small oasis to drink from
Using the same style have the tiny giraffe be chased away from the oasis by giant beavers
That's a very different art style, I want it to be a minimalist, muted color cartoon style
Make him bite the handle of the sword, not the little sideways part between the handle and the blade
Now, generate an image using the same style where the tiny giraffe is along again in the desert with a comically large bandaid on it
Do it again but make him sad
Now generate an image of the tiny giraffe in the same style trying to pull a sword from the sand like excalibur in the middle of the desert
That's good, but make the sword tiny like the giraffe. Also make the giraffe trying to pull out the sword by biting the handle
Make him bite the handle of the sword, not the little sideways part between the handle and the blade
Now generate an image using that style from earlier but have a heroic image of the giraffe wielding the sword sideways in its mouth
Now generate an image of the giraffe chasing off the beavers from the oasis with the sword in the same style as before
That's good but make him tiny, remember?
See how he's much larger than the beavers. Make him tiny, as in the same size as the beavers or smaller
Now, using the same style generate an image of the giraffe standing triumphantly over the empty oasis with the words "YAY" above him
Generate an image of a tiny giraffe in a Regular Show, minimalistic cartoony style in a desert spotting a group of giraffes far in the distance.

Now, in the same style, have the tiny giraffe run towards the giraffes happily just to find out that they were a mirage and now he's sad.

Have the tiny giraffe running towards the group of giraffes and becoming sad when he finds out they're a mirage.

Generate an image in the same style of the tiny giraffe being sad and like overly seriously depressed, dark shadow over the face, cigarette in mouth, crying. Also, make it black and white.

Then, go back to the original colored art style, have the tiny giraffe who's crying be tapped on the shoulder by a giraffe.

Now generate an image in the same style of the tiny giraffe being happy with the other giraffe at an oasis.
