Generate a tiny giraffe walking across a desert in a regular show art style
Try more of a minimalist less vibrant color style
Using the same style, have the tiny giraffe find a small oasis to drink from
Using the same style have the tiny giraffe be chased away from the oasis by giant beavers
That's a very different art style, I want it to be a minimalist, muted color cartoon style
Make him bite the handle of the sword, not the little sideways part between the handle and the blade
Now, generate an image using the same style where the tiny giraffe is along again in the desert with a comically large bandaid on it
Do it again but make him sad
Now generate an image of the tiny giraffe in the same style trying to pull a sword from the sand like excalibur in the middle of the desert
That's good, but make the sword tiny like the giraffe. Also make the giraffe trying to pull out the sword by biting the handle
Make him bite the handle of the sword, not the little sideways part between the handle and the blade
Now generate an image using that style from earlier but have a heroic image of the giraffe wielding the sword sideways in its mouth
Now generate an image of the giraffe chasing off the beavers from the oasis with the sword in the same style as before
That's good but make him tiny, remember?
See how he's much larger than the beavers. Make him tiny, as in the same size as the beavers or smaller
Now, using the same style generate an image of the giraffe standing triumphantly over the empty oasis with the words "YAY" above him
